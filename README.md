## 📊 Credit Risk Assessment
### 📚 Overview
Welcome to the Credit Risk Assessment repository! This project focuses on evaluating credit risk using a machine learning approach. It contains a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, along with detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), a robust machine learning model, and a pickled version of the trained model for convenient deployment.

### 📁 Contents
* 📊 Dataset: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
* 🔍 EDA: Exploratory data analysis files providing insights into the dataset.
* 🤖 Model: The machine learning model developed for credit risk assessment.
* 📦 Pickled Model: A serialized version of the trained model for easy future use.

### 📈 Dataset
This dataset features various attributes related to borrowers' credit history, demographics, and loan specifics.
The target variable indicates whether a borrower has defaulted on their loan.

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA folder includes:
* Summary statistics of the dataset.
* Visualizations to comprehend distributions and relationships between features.
* Insights into factors affecting credit risk.

### 🤖 Model
The project utilizes XGBoost, renowned for its effectiveness in classification tasks.
Hyperparameters have been fine-tuned to maximize model accuracy.

### 📦 Pickled Model
The trained model is saved as credit_risk_model.pkl, allowing for easy loading and prediction in future applications.
